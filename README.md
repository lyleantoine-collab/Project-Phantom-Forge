# Project Phantom Forge 
 
 An open-source, privacy-first AI companion that guides users through trauma-resicting drills—eye-movement, distress rating, image replacement. Experimental. Not therapy. Built for folks who need breathing room while waiting for real help. 
 
 ## How it works 
 - Follow simple bilateral cues—dots on screen.
 - Recall, reframe, rerate pain. 
 - Lock in a new memory scene. 
 - Stay grounded. No chat logs, no cloud leaks. 
 
 ## Disclaimer 
 No professional care. No diagnosis. No liability. 
 If you're in crisis—dial nine-eight-eight or emergency. 
 This is a prototype, handle with gloves.
